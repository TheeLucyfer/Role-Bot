# Role-Bot
This bot was custom built for the Galorant discord server. It adds the appropiate competitive region role to your current region. That way users don't have to select their regional competitive role, after already assigning themselves to a regional normal role. If this were to be forked the only thing that needs to be updated are the roles object file, and then the new import to main bot.mjs file.
